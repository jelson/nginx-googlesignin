By default, the configuration files in "conf" are set up to run the
googleauth.py script directly. googleauth.py uses CherryPy, which has a built-in
web server that is fine for this purpose.

However, if you expect high traffic you might want to use uwsgi as an
application server instead. This directory has an example uwsgi configuration
file, and an example systemd service configuration file showing how to invoke
uswgi.
